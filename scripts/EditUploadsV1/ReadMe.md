## üîí How It Works
- Runs only in **your browser**, nothing external.  
- Adds an **Edit Upload (EU)** button on images and attachments.  
- Loads the image into a `<canvas>` ‚Üí this instantly **wipes all EXIF / metadata**.  
- You edit locally (brush, crop, blur, text, etc.) and save.  
- The clean PNG is dropped back into Discord‚Äôs chat box like a normal upload.  
- 100% local client-side ‚Äî no API, no servers, no AI.
